# Translate_Text_to_Speech
A simple Test to Speech Translator. This bit of code will enable you to translate any text to speech or mp3 from English to any of the 51 languages inside.
I used gTTs and a bit of python codes.

To run the code u need python installed on your machine 
And then use pip to install gTTs.

To understand what's going on be sure to go through the code and read the comments. Thanks
